This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset comprising 8,336 observations, with each observation representing a worker in a specific department.
The key focus areas for investigation are age, gender (every personed identified as a female or a male only in the survey,hence no other outputs for this part) , absent hours, and job title. 
The primary goal is to gain insights into the distribution of total hours of absence within the workforce and identify potential patterns that may emerge from the data.

The analysis will involve examining the distribution of total absence hours across the workforce.
Various statistical measures, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, will be employed to describe the central tendency and spread of the data.
Additionally, visualizations, such as histograms and scatter plots, may be generated to provide a clearer understanding of the data distribution.
The code file includes comments marked with '#' symbols to provide clarity on each step of the analysis.
These comments serve as a guide for the reader, explaining the rationale behind specific decisions or operations performed during the EDA.

It is important to note that the dataset used in this analysis is based on real-world data from a specific context.
However, the analysis is conducted for personal purposes, meaning that the insights gained are not intended for external publication or commercial use.
The primary aim is personal exploration and understanding of patterns within the data.
